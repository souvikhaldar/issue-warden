## Simple Issue Tracker 
Assign issues to users.

Whenever an Issue is created or assigned to different user(in case of update), an email is triggered exactly after 12 mins to the particular user saying issue has been assigned to him/her.


Every 24 hours an email is triggered to every users with details of all the issues assigned to him/her. Here 24 hours should be configurable.(for e.g we may ask you to send emails for every 10 hours or even every 10 secs)
